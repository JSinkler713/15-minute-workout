# 15 Minute Workout

## How it works

A quick way to get 4 exercises that you should complete as a circuit for as many reps as possible in 15 minutes. Exercises are randomly assigned, so each time you open up the app and tap for a workout, you get a different set for variety. A timer starts and will alert the user when it is time to rest.
